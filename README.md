# Smart Garden App

This project is my frist app and its not completed yet, need to turn for web, because today is only for mobile.
I did using technologies HTML, CSS, PHP and JQUERY.
Have some issues about the design but it will be repaired soon.

To open the project, follow the steps bellow:

  1. By the fact that the app do not have a server, you need to open on local, so **Open a servidor on your computer to host**
  2. Open PHPMyAdmin and Import the file "db_estufa" to create the database.
  3. Move all the files on github to your server's folder.
  4. Open on web the app.
  5. Press Ctrl+Shift+I
  6. Press Ctrl+Shift+M to see as mobile view
  
  **Test user
  Login: admin
  Password: admin**
